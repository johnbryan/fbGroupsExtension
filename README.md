Extension to sort posts in FB groups in chronological order.

Dena told me she was annoyed that every time she opened her "Everything is free"
Facebook group to see if there were new posts, she had to change the setting to
"recent posts first" to easily see what she wanted. Changing that setting adds a
URL parameter, so this chrome extension just updates the URL for any Facebook
Groups page to have the sorting parameter by default.

I used https://pixlr.com (free online photoshop) to make the logos and to edit a
screenshot to submit to Chrome for approval.

This project turned out to be easier than I anticipated, and only needed a few
things beyond what you do in the tutorial for how to make an extension. Stack
Overflow came to the rescue for those things, as usual.
